The current owner's late father Madiralla Narsa Reddy was the man behind Gokul Brindavan. In 1959, he came to Nagpur to pursue LLB. He and his friends observed that students in Nagpur hostels weren’t content with the food. At the age of 22, he along with his fellow batch mates took a place (the place where Gokul Brindavan is situated even today) on rent and started a small food unit called as Reddy Mess. The business picked up momentum soon and many students coming to Nagpur for their education started eating at the mess. The unit was such a success that to manage it my father had to give up his education in the 2nd year itself. Later, in 1982, my elder brother Manamatha Reddy also started supporting my father in the business.
